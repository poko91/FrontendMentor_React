## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Leaflet] (https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/) - map API
- Ipify - (https://geo.ipify.org/) - IP Geolocation API

### What I learned

This was my first experience using a map API, Leaflet was a great tool to achieve that. It was easier to implement it using React Leaflet components.
